Last Friday the Network of Argentine Scientist and Researchers in The Netherlands was officially launched. I am thrilled to be part of this network and it was my honor to present my research in this event. Many other researchers of a variety of fields presented their fields of expertise. It was an enriching meeting and it gave us the opportunity to meet with more Argentinian colleagues working in The Netherlands. 

I would like to thank the organizers for puting together an exciting program and for a smooth organization; the meeting was a success. I am confident that the Network will keep increasing and serve as a tool for more scientific collaborations and exchanges between Argentina and The Netherlands.
