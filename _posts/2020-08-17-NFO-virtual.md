On Monday 17th August The 16th International Conference on Near-Field Optics, Nanophotonics and Related Techniques (NFO) started in a virtual format. 
The organizers, led by Reuven Gordon from the University of Victoria, Canada, have put together a fantastic program and smoothly organized the virtual conference. 

I think I will enjoy the proposed scheme that combines live sessions and recorded presentations. 
The organizers proposed a 2-hour-long daily live program, in which a Keynote lecture and two invited talks are presented as a kick-off. Later, there are 3-min-long contributed
"highlights" presentation, where each presenter introduces the most important aspects of their work. This is complemented with recorded video 
presentations with extended explanations and in-depth interpretation of the results, which can be accessed in the conference website. Additionally, questions, comments
and discussions can be added at the website, so scientific interactions will also have their space.

I believe this combination of live and recorded contact allows participants from all over the world to enjoy the conference and engage in the discussions, without
reaching saturation since each user can find their own time to watch the video presentations.

I am looking forward to present our results on nanoplasmonics and chirality and to discuss with the NFO community.
