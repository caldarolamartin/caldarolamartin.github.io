Last week I attended, with almost all the NanoOptics group from TU Delft, the 15th edition of the International Conference on Near Field Optics and related techniques, NFO15 for short. 
The conference was held at the University of Technology Troyes (UTT), in France and was a great experience. Excellent speakers and high quality research combined in a great venue at UTT.
Several topics involving nanotechnology and optical techniques at the nanoscale were presented and discussed. 
I enjoyed sharing a conference with my colleagues from TU Delft and all over the world. There were many outstanding presentations, for example, I specifically enjoyed the presentation on silicon photonics by  Prof. Jelena Vuckovic, who showed a new way to realize on-chip optical elements with excellent performance using inverse design. The session on Temperature effects, opened with an excellent keynote talk by Guillaumee Baffou was of special interest for me since I also presented our work on nanothermometry. 

Everyone at the NanoOptics group is also very proaud of our colleague, Irina Komen, who won a prize for the best poster presentation. Congratulations Irina!!
