Two days ago an article presenting our latest publication "[Circular Dichroism Measurement of Single Metal Nanoparticles Using Photothermal Imaging](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b03853)" was published at the TU Delft [website](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2019/tnw/combined-technique-measures-nanostructures-ten-times-better-than-before/) and also at the Leiden University [website](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/news/2019/12/combined-technique-measures-nanostructures-ten-times-better-than-before). We are proud of our collaborative work and we love to share it with the community. 

In [this](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b03853) paper, we show that we can measure the chirality of nano-objectes, for example, gold nanostructures, with a ten-times improved sensitivity. This is now possible through the combination of two techniques, a challenging task we manage in collaboration with people from the [single-molecule optics group](https://www.single-molecule.nl/) at Leiden university.

I would like acknowledged all my colleagues contributing to this paper, hopefully the first one of many and to especially thank [Jerwin de Graaf](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/j.n.degraaf/?no_cache=1) from the TU Delft communication department who took the time to talk with me about our research project and write the nice article.
