Today I started as the firs [Kavli postdoctoral fellow](http://kavli.tudelft.nl/kavli-postdoctoral-fellowships/) at the [Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft (KIND)](http://kavli.tudelft.nl/) at the [Technical University Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/)

I am thrilled to be here, in such an vibrant working place, surrounded by passionate colleagues doing great science. I will be sharing my time between two groups: [Kuipers lab](http://kuiperslab.tudelft.nl/pages/kuipers/) at the [Quantum Nanoscience Department](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences/about-faculty/departments/quantum-nanoscience/) (QN) and the [Aubin-Tam Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/aubintamgroup/) at the [Bionanoscience department](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences/about-faculty/departments/bionanoscience/) (BN).

I've been very welcome by everyone in both groups and departments and I am looking forward to having great collaborations!
