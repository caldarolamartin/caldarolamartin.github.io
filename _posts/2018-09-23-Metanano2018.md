Last week I had a great time at the conference METANANO2018 in Sochi, Rusia. It was an excellent conference with great science and an amazing opportunity to meet new colleagues from all over the world. I presented our research on nanothermometry, from my time in Leiden. Fortunately, interesting ideas and discussions about our work were raised, especially by our colleagues from Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden), Ruggero Verre and Mikael KÃ¤ll. Thanks for inspiring discussions and new insights! 

I have to specially thank Sergey Makarov for the invitation and Pavel Belov and all the organizers for a great week of science and social activities, such as bike rides and the visit to the Skypark.
