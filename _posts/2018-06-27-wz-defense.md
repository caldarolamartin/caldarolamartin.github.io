I am very proud to see Weichun Zhang getting his PhD degree today! Congratulations, Weichun! 
 
After 4 long years of hard work at the lab, Weichun defended successfully his PhD today. 

It was my honor co-supervise him, with Prof. Michel Orrit, and share long hours in the lab and so many fruitfully scientific discussions. I know I've learned many interesting facts about gold nanorods and fluorescence enhancement of single molecules along the way. Now Weichun will continue his career as a postdoc. 

I wish him all the best for his next position!
