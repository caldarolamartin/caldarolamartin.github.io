My new website using github pages is up. It uses Jekyll, which is is a new tool for me so I'm still experimenting with it. The template I used is called [Beatifull-Jekyll](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/), developed by [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com/). So far, so good. I hope you enjoy the website.
