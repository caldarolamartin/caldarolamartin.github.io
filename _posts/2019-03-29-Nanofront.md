Last week I attended to the NanoFront winter retreat in Courchevel, France.  [NanoFront](https://casimir.researchschool.nl/nanofront-1962.html), is a consortium of nanoscientists at the 
[Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft](http://kavli.tudelft.nl/) and the [Leiden Institute of Physics](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/physics) (LION) which aims to 
push the frontiers of nanoscience forward. 

We had a great scientific meeting with amazing presentations and lots of interaction among colleagues. I specifically enjoyed the discussions triggered by the talks in different topics, which were coordinated
by the people from [Known Innovation](http://knowinnovation.com/). This was a new approach to me, where we were encouraged to think creatively to come up with new research ideas, combining different fields and topics.
By the end of the week we gathered a small team and worked on an interesting idea to apply what we know from fundamental research to attack an interesting societal problem. I hope we can push this forward to contribute to the solution.

Additionally, I also had the chance to present a plenary talk about my current project here in Delft, which was a great opportunity to get feedback from my colleagues. I enjoyed presenting and meeting new people who are
interested in my project.
