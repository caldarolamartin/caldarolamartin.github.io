A couple of weeks ago I participated in the NWO-organized workshop "Physics with Industry" (PWI). It was my fourth year in a row, so it is 
well known by now that I deeply enjoy the workshop. The idea is that 5 different companies bring a problem they have and present it to a group of physicist that 
take the challenge to shed light on it or solve it. [Here]() is a video that explains better the idea and even has the testimony of [Amin Moradi](http://single-molecule.nl/people/), a colleague from the [single-molecule optics group](http://single-molecule.nl) at Leiden. 

This year, once more, I enjoyed collaborating with a diverse group of young professionals, sharing the passion for solving problems. However, there is an extra unique flavor in the art of solving applied problems, as it is usually required for PWI: the solution we propose has to work in a specific environment and conditions that are beyond our control. This is quite different from the usual approach I take in the Lab, where isolate our experiment to detect exactly what we aim to detect and the environmental conditions are well controlled


In this occasion, I was part of the Somni Solutions(http://www.somnisolutions.com) team and we addressed the problem of transportation of an extremely sensitive accelerometer the company developed recently. This was a challenge and after a week of hard team work we proposed a few realistic solutions that the company will test in practice. This gives me a sense of satisfaction since something we designed will soon became a reality in a commercial product. As the cherry on top, our team was selected to present the results at the meeting [physics@veldhoven]() this January, so we are thrilled to share our experience and results with the rest of the community.

Last but not least, I must acknowledge all the people involved in the organization, both from NWO and from the Lorentz centre, who contributed to an amazing week of physics applied to industry and peer collaboration.
