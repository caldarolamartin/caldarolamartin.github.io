Last week I participated as speaker at the pre-program of the [Kavli Colloquium](http://kavli.tudelft.nl/kavli-colloquia/) at the [Kavli Institute of Nanoscience Delft](http://kavli.tudelft.nl/). It was an honor to present the research I have been doing since I moved here as a [KIND fellow](http://kavli.tudelft.nl/kavli-postdoctoral-fellowships/), in which we are aiming to detect single-protein folding dynamics without using fluorescent labels.
Stef Smeets, also a KIND fellow, presented an interesting approach for electron microscopy that he will use to study biomolecules and new materials. 
We both got interesting questions and feedback from our colleagues.

Afterwards, the main program started and we all enjoyed a fantastic talk by [Joanna Aizenberg](https://aizenberglab.seas.harvard.edu/research) form Harvard University where she presented a variety of new bio-inspired materials with quite peculiar macroscopic properties, for example, an extremely slippery surface
and a anti-vandalism new paint.

Finally, I would like to thank the directors of the KIND institute for the invitation and all the colleagues that attended and contributed to the exciting scientific discussions.
