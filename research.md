This is a selected list of the research projects I was involved

## Current research projects

At TU delft I am working to develop a new optical technique to study protein (un)folding dynamics, ideally at single-molecule level.


## Past research projects 

### Single-molecule Optics group

While a postdoc at [Michel Orrti's group](https://www.single-molecule.nl/) at Leiden Institute of Physics ([LION](http://physics.leidenuniv.nl/)), I was part of the following research projects.


#### Fluorescence enhancement using individual gold nanorods 

Recently we used the technique named DNA transient binding to repetitively place individual molecules in the near field of a single gold nanorod.

Chem. Chem. Phys. 20, 20468-20475 (2018) ([link](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/cp/c8cp03114b)).  

We presented a innovative way to compute enhancement factors from time-correlated single-photon counting experiments that avoids arbitrary binning of the data. We called this '_binning free_' analysis and we showed that it provides relaiable and consistent results with the other methods used in the literature.

#### Nonlinear signals enhanced by gold nanorods

We showed, for the first time at room temperature, enhancement of two-photon-excited luminescence of _single_ semiconductor quantum dots. To achieve this, we used gold nanorods to concentrate the field in a sub-difraction volume and showed an enhancement factor of more than 10.000!

#### Gold nanorods as nanothermometers

We used the anti-Stokes photoluminescence emission to measure the absolute temperature of an individual gold nanorods. This method provides a way to access the temperature in the surrounding media of a gold nanorod without the need of any temperature calibration.

#### Single-molecule electrochemistry

We used enhanced-fluorescence detection to optical study the electrochemical properties of single methylene blue molecules.

### Quantum electronics Laboratory

During my PhD I worked on a combined multipropose microscope. It combined a home-made atomic force microscopy with a fluorescence wide field and confocal optical microscope. 

With this setup I studied novel dielectric nanoantennas that provide good fluorescence enhancement and SERS capabilities with ultralow heat generation.

enhanced spectroscopies with ultra-low heat conversion_. Nature Communications, 6:7915 (2015)
([link](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8915)).

I also studied a complicated biophysical problem in the area of mechanotransduction. We studied the formation of focal adhesion proteins when we apply a controlled, local and functional mechanical stimulus on a live cell.
